# Password-Generator
This application is a random password generator, where you will follow and answer the window prompts asking if you want you password to be in length of 8-128 characters long, then structured with characters being Lowercase, Uppercase, Numbers, and Symbols. Once those prompts are completed the application will then generate a random password based off the prompts answered.
